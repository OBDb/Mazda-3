## Generations

The Mazda 3 has gone through four main generations since its introduction, each with its own characteristics and improvements:

- **First Generation (2004-2009)**: Introduced as a replacement for the Mazda Familia/323/Proteg√©, the first-generation Mazda 3 was built on the Ford C1 platform shared with the Ford Focus. Available in both sedan and hatchback body styles, it featured a sporty design with good handling characteristics. Engine options included a 2.0L producing around 148 hp and a more powerful 2.3L with approximately 160 hp. A high-performance Mazdaspeed3 variant was introduced in 2007 with a turbocharged 2.3L engine producing 263 hp.

- **Second Generation (2010-2013)**: The second-generation Mazda 3 featured a redesigned exterior with improved aerodynamics while maintaining the same basic platform. Engine options included a 2.0L and a new 2.5L that replaced the previous 2.3L, now producing 167 hp. In 2012, Mazda introduced their Skyactiv technology with a new direct-injection 2.0L engine for improved fuel efficiency and performance.

- **Third Generation (2014-2018)**: This generation marked a significant step forward with the adoption of Mazda's KODO "Soul of Motion" design language and full implementation of Skyactiv technology. The car featured a more rigid body, better handling, and improved fuel efficiency. Engine options included Skyactiv-G 2.0L (155 hp) and 2.5L (184 hp) direct-injection units with either six-speed manual or automatic transmissions.

- **Fourth Generation (2019-present)**: The current generation Mazda 3 continues the KODO design language with a more premium approach, reflecting Mazda's upmarket strategy. Initially offered with a 2.5L Skyactiv-G engine producing 186 hp, a turbocharged 2.5L option with 250 hp was added for the 2021 model year. This generation also introduced all-wheel drive as an option for the first time in the model's history, further enhancing its driving dynamics and appeal.
